## The Challenge

Healthcare organizations needed a secure, standards-compliant way to exchange patient information across different systems while ensuring data privacy and regulatory compliance.

## The Solution

Built a robust API platform following healthcare industry standards:

- **FHIR-compliant endpoints** for interoperability
- **End-to-end encryption** for data at rest and in transit
- **Comprehensive audit trails** for compliance reporting
- **Granular permission system** for data access control

## Security Measures

- All data encrypted using AES-256
- Regular penetration testing
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
